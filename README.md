# 👋 Hi there! I'm Jezer Ávila  

🎓 **Control and Automation Engineer** with a strong passion for **technology and programming**.  
Although my background is in engineering, I’ve always been interested in understanding how applications work from the inside, which led me to learn programming in a **self-taught** way.

## 💻 A bit about my journey

- I learned **Java**, **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Git**, **GitHub**, and **SQL** on my own.  
- Through **Udemy**, I took courses where I learned to use **Java Swing**, creating a simple calculator as a practice project.  
- I completed a **Frontend Development** course with **Código Facilito**, where I deepened my web development knowledge.  
- I self-studied **React**, developing several **personal projects** to strengthen my skills.  
- My interest in **QA Testing** led me to enroll in the **QA Tester program at TripleTen**, where I learned:  
  - **Test automation** with **Python**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **Requests**  
  - **API testing** with **Postman**  
  - **Bug tracking and reporting** with **Jira**  
  - **Database queries** with **SQL**

## 🧠 Currently

I’m developing **personal projects** to keep practicing and improving my test automation skills while looking for professional opportunities in the **Quality Assurance** field.  
My goal is to continue learning, grow as a QA professional, and contribute to teams focused on **building high-quality software**.
